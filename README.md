# Smart Waste Monitoring: Sensors for the Bin

**Optimizing Waste Collection Through Data & IoT**<br>
Hosted by **VEGA**

## ðŸš€ Short Overview
Many cities and waste management companies lack a transparent overview of the fill levels of their waste containers and rely on rigid collection routes. We are looking for innovative ideas on how sensor data can be used more intelligently to make waste collection processes more efficient and to better inform citizens about container fill levels.

## ðŸ“– Long Description
In many cities, waste containersâ€”particularly for glass, paper, and recyclablesâ€”are emptied according to fixed schedules, regardless of their actual fill levels. This often leads to inefficient collection routes: half-empty containers are emptied unnecessarily, causing avoidable costs and emissions, or full containers are serviced too late, resulting in littering and citizen dissatisfaction.

At the same time, there is often no central, transparent overview of the current status of containers. Neither waste management operators nor the public can reliably tell whether a container is full, due for collection, or currently overloaded.

Modern fill-level sensors, like those produced by VEGA, offer a crucial technological foundation for managing these processes intelligently and based on data. But how can this data be used effectively to make waste management smarter, more sustainable, and more citizen-focused?

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Solution
We are looking for creative, practical, and technologically feasible ideas for how fill-level data from waste containers can be used intelligentlyâ€”whether for route optimization, public information, or entirely new application scenarios.

The goal is to develop a user-centered dashboard that meets the needs of waste management operators while also providing transparent, accessible information to the public.
Solutions should take into account both ecological and economic aspects and be open to integration with existing systems.

As an optional addition, a business plan outlining the scalability and real-world applicability of the proposed solution would be welcome.
